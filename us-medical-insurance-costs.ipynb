    "The purpose of this project is to demonstrate python fundements while also investigating some common questions about health insurance costs. There are various libraries that could make the process much easier (pandas, numpy, ect), but it is imporant to be able to logically hard code various procedures. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions To be Answered:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the average insurance cost in the United States? \n",
    "* Are there more men or women in this data set?  \n",
    "* Are medical insurance costs higher for those who have children?\n",
    "* How much does medical insurance costs vary by region in the United States? \n",
    "* (time permiting) is there a model to be used to predict medical insurance costs given the below features?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions I will write a class called patientInformation() with the following methods: \n",
    "- average()\n",
    "- analyzeGender()\n",
    "- analyzeChildren()\n",
    "- uniqueRegion() \n",
    "\n",
    "I will then combine all of the data into one dictionary. \n",

    "### The Data Set: \n",
    "The data set consits of 1339 randomly sampled patients with varying age, sex, bmi, number of children, smoking status, and region in the United States. The outcome variable is the medical insurance cost.\n",
